# Capstone Project Report

## Future Work

While this project successfully developed and evaluated several models for disease prediction based on symptoms, including promising ensemble approaches, there are several avenues for future research and development:

1.  **Dataset Expansion and Enrichment:**
    *   **Increase Sample Size:** Acquire more patient data to improve model robustness and generalization.
    *   **Expand Symptom Vocabulary:** Incorporate a wider range of symptoms, potentially using standardized medical ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT, MeSH).
    *   **Include More Diseases:** Extend the model to predict a broader spectrum of diseases, including rarer conditions.
    *   **Demographic and Clinical Data:** If ethically permissible and available, integrate patient demographic data (age, gender) and relevant clinical history (pre-existing conditions, medications) as features, which could significantly enhance predictive accuracy.

2.  **Advanced Modeling Techniques:**
    *   **Deep Learning:** Explore deep learning architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers, which might capture complex relationships between symptoms more effectively.
    *   **Advanced Ensemble Methods:** Investigate more sophisticated ensemble techniques beyond soft voting, such as stacking or gradient boosting machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost).
    *   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Implement XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to provide insights into model predictions, increasing trust and clinical utility.

3.  **Feature Engineering and Selection:**
    *   **Symptom Weighting/Severity:** Incorporate symptom severity or duration as features, rather than just presence/absence.
    *   **Interaction Terms:** Explore interactions between symptoms that might be indicative of specific diseases.
    *   **Automated Feature Selection:** Utilize advanced feature selection algorithms to identify the most predictive subset of symptoms.

4.  **Model Deployment and Evaluation:**
    *   **Real-World Validation:** Conduct prospective studies or pilot tests in a clinical setting to evaluate the model's performance on real-world patient data. (Requires ethical approval and collaboration with healthcare professionals).
    *   **User Feedback Integration:** Enhance the application (`app/`) to collect feedback from users (potentially clinicians) on prediction accuracy and usability, using this feedback for iterative improvement.
    *   **Longitudinal Studies:** Track patient outcomes over time to assess the long-term impact and accuracy of the predictions.

5.  **Addressing Bias and Fairness:**
    *   **Bias Audit:** Conduct a thorough analysis to identify potential biases in the dataset or model related to demographics or specific patient groups.
    *   **Fairness Metrics:** Evaluate the model using fairness metrics to ensure equitable performance across different populations.

6.  **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
    *   **Advanced Techniques:** Employ more sophisticated hyperparameter optimization techniques like Bayesian optimization or genetic algorithms to potentially find better model configurations.

By pursuing these directions, the capabilities and reliability of the disease prediction system can be further enhanced, potentially leading to a valuable tool for clinical decision support.
